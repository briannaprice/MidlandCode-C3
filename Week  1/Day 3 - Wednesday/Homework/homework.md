## Homework

* Create a contact page with a well layed out and clear to follow form. This form will not be connected to anything as of yet so don't worry about that. 
* Utilize your newly acquired skills with layout design to improve your existing about page. This can be done with any styling you prefer but should at least contain some floating and/or some absolute/fixed positioning. 
* Take the contact page and add it to your existing repository. Update any styling on the other pages to match as you see fit.
* Finalize any in class work you have yet to complete.

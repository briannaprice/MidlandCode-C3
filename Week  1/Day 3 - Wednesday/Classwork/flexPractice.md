## Practice Instructions
* Utilizing the file of the same name (flexPractice.jpg) build a site using flex to achieve the design in the image.
* The divs with numbers should be correct order in the HTML and you should use CSS to change their orders:
    Correct:
    ``` html
    <div class="">1</div>
    <div class="">2</div>
    <div class="">3</div>
    <div class="">4</div>
    <div class="">5</div>
    <div class="">6</div>
    ```
    Incorrect:
    ``` html
    <div class="">1</div>
    <div class="">6</div>
    <div class="">2</div>
    <div class="">5</div>
    <div class="">4</div>
    <div class="">3</div>
    ```
* There should be a minimum height for each div but there should be no maximum height.
* Once you are finished with the styling, add actual content of varying sizes to the divs to ensure they still flex appropriately. This can be done with filler text or with actual content of your choice.
* Follow the instructions in flexBox.html in order to achieve the desired effects.

## In Class Work

* Create a weekly schedule for yourself. 
    * This should include 7 days (M-Su) as table headers across the top
    * There should be three table headers vertically along the left side for "Morning","Afternoon","Evening"
    * At least one item should span across multiple columns
    * At least one Item should span across multiple rows
    * Add styling (either in-line or via external stylesheet) to ensure it is working properly for multiple columns / rows 

* Take the existing schedule you wrote earlier and add a form to it.
    * Update the schedule for a fictitious company that provides a service
    * Add a contact form with pertinent information about your service that you would want to know from the customer
    * Include at least 1 text, 1 set of radios, 1 set of checkboxes, and one select

* Set up the rest of the page around those two elements to make a fully-fledged page
* Push it to github in a repo of your choice. This repo will be used throughout the week as we add onto it, so make sure you name it something that makes sense.

#  Agile Methodology
Agile Software Development, or Agile for short, originated within the software development community as an alternative to traditional project management practices. It focuses on adaptive planning, continuous improvement, experimentation, and customer involvement.
The goal of Agile is to deliver fast and often, while allowing for quick responses to change.

## Agile vs. Waterfall
Traditional project management practices follow a waterfall approach:

While this approach works well for some projects (i.e. construction, infrastructure, etc.), it does not allow for any review or input from the customer (a.k.a. stakeholder) until the project is complete. When dealing with software and other more ambiguous products, this often results in a product that doesn’t match the customer’s needs.

Agile focuses on an adaptive planning approach:

Adaptive planning allows a team to deliver small portions of a product on a regular schedule. In Agile, this also includes regular demos and opportunities for customer feedback. This allows for adjustments to the current development approach based on the customer’s needs.

## The Agile Manifesto
While Agile-like practices were being used since the 1950s, the term “Agile” became popular in 2001 after a group of software developers met in Silicon Valley and wrote the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https:// agilemanifesto.org) in an attempt to share their development philosophy with the tech industry. The Manifesto focuses on four basic values and twelve principles of development.
### The Four Values
-	**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
-	**Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
-	**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.
-	**Responding to change** over following a plan.
### The Twelve Principles
-	Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
-	Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
-	Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
-	Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
-	Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
-	The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
-	Working software is the primary measure of progress.
-	Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
-	Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
-	Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
-	The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
-	At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## SCRUM
Scrum is a framework based on Agile. It promotes self-organizing, self-motivating teams that deliver small, fully functional pieces of a deliverable in iterations called Sprints. Sprints can be one to four weeks long, with two or three weeks being the industry standard.
Each sprint incorporates regular, timeboxed meetings called Ceremonies. These ceremonies include:
-	Daily Scrum: A stand-up meeting where each member of the team provides a quick status update. Timeboxed for 15 minutes.
-	Sprint Planning: A meeting where work for the sprint, called user stories, is identified and organized by priority. The team then identifies which of the development team members will own and work on those stories that are assigned to the sprint. Timeboxed for 1 hour per week of Sprint.
-	Backlog Grooming: A meeting where the Product Owner explains the who, what, and why of the user stories, and the team identifies the how. The team also identifies and assigns the effort behind the work by assigning a value to the user story called story points. Timebox varies depending on team requirements.
-	Sprint Demo: A demonstration of the completed sprint work that is provided to the customer/stakeholder for feedback and approval. Timeboxed for 30 minutes, but can be up to an hour depending on the amount of work to be demoed.
-	Sprint Retrospective: A post-mortem discussion of the Sprint, focusing on what went well and what could be done better. Opportunities for team improvement and experimentation are identified during this ceremony. Timeboxed for 30 minutes.
Scrum works best when a team is focused on delivering a single product or suite of related products. The Scrum Team is composed of:
-	Three to nine developers with the collective skills to design, build, and test any deliverables related to the product.
-	A Product Owner who acts as the voice of the customer and is responsible for building and managing the work, called the Backlog.
-	A Scrum Master who facilitates the Scrum Ceremonies, protects the team from external distractions, removes impediments, and is looked to as the expert in Agile and Scrum practices.

## KANBAN
Kanban is another framework used by Agile teams. It is based in Lean Manufacturing methods and focuses on reducing waste, limiting work in progress, and identifying opportunities to improve overall efficiency and speed up the delivery of end products.
Kanban works best when a team is required to work on multiple products or services, and when visibility on the progress is highly important. Kanban can also be used in tandem or as a supplement to Scrum.
In Kanban, work is visualized using a Kanban Board:
-	The board is divided into columns called swim lanes. Each swim lane represents a stage in the development process. 
-	Work moves from left to right, and is prioritized from top to bottom, with the most pressing or important work at the top.
-	Each swim lane is assigned a WIP (work-in-progress) number, which identifies the maximum number of work items that can be in the given lane at any time. 
-	If a lane’s WIP is maxed out and work within that lane is not moving, this identifies a bottleneck that should be addressed in order for work to flow more efficiently.
